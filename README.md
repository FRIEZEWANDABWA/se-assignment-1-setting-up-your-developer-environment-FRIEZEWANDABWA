Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


FIRST PROCESS BEFORE THE INSTALATION,CHECK FOR COMPATIBILITY. the minimus specs should be:
4-bit processor with at least 2 cores and 1 GHz processing speed
4GB RAM
64GB storage space (in addition to the space for the operating system installation software)
DirectX 12 or later graphics card with WDDM 2.0 driver
A high-def display of 720p
TPM 2.0
Secure Boot-capable UEFI firmware

SECOND PROCEEDURE IS TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE 
Visit the site https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 to download the media creation tool.
Navigate to the Create Windows 11 installation media link, and click Download Now.

The download for the Media Creation Tool will begin.
Once the tool downloads, double-click on the file in your download and run it. You may be asked for permission to run the program, so go ahead and approve it.
Now that you have the Media Creation Tool running, follow the directions to download the ISO file (the file used to install Windows 11) to your device. 
Make sure you select USB Flash Drive when prompted to download the file directly to your USB drive and format it properly for installation later.

git clone github.com/FRIEZEWANDABWA/se-assignment-1-setting-up-your-developer-environment-FRIEZEWANDABWA

after it has been cloned to the lAPTOP, CD TO that assingment then open it through the vs code using command code .
In the vs code you can do the change to the work before you push it back to git hub.
after finishing working on it use the commands
git add . to add the assingment
the git commit -m " assignment-1-setting-up-you"  to commint the work done
then git push to update with the one in the git hub
example of my work done is below
![resp](https://github.com/FRIEZEWANDABWA/se-assignment-1-setting-up-your-developer-environment-FRIEZEWANDABWA/blob/2669c304d83edbc5893b91c43e7f015b4ca61fb9/git%20commit.png)

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

Visit the Official Python Website:

Go to https://www.python.org/.
Navigate to the Downloads Page:

On the homepage, click on the "Downloads" link in the top menu.
The website should automatically detect your operating system and suggest the appropriate download. For example, for Windows, it will show a "Download Python 3.x.x" button.
Download the Installer:

Click the "Download Python 3.x.x" button to download the installer for the latest version of Python.
Step 2: Install Python
For Windows:
Run the Installer:

Locate the downloaded .exe file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run the installer.
Customize Installation:

Important: Check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH". This ensures that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable, which makes it easier to run Python from the command line.
Click "Customize installation" if you want to choose optional features or simply click "Install Now" to proceed with the default installation.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening the Terminal and typing python3 --version to check the installed version.

Challenge: After installing Python on Windows, the python command is not recognized in the Command Prompt.
Solution:
Reinstall Python and ensure to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation
Challenge: Slow download speeds or connection timeouts during Python installation or package installation via pip.
Solution:
Check Network Connection: Ensure your internet connection is stable and not restricted by firewalls or proxies.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

Download get-pip.py:

Open your browser and navigate to the get-pip.py file.
Save the file to your computer.
Run the get-pip.py Script:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where get-pip.py is saved.
Run the script using Python:
python get-pip.py

Verify pip Installation:

After the installation completes, verify that pip is installed
pip --version


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

Download MySQL Installer:

Go to the MySQL Downloads page.https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Click on the "Download" button for the MySQL Installer for Windows.
Choose the "full" version (larger download, includes all components).
Run the Installer:

Locate the downloaded .msi file and double-click it to run the installer.
Follow the Installation Steps:

Choose the setup type. "Developer Default" is recommended as it installs MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and other useful tools.
Click "Next" and follow the prompts.
The installer will check for requirements and install any missing components.
Configuration:

Configure the MySQL Server:
Choose "Standalone MySQL Server" and click "Next".
Select the appropriate configuration type, usually "Development Machine".
Set the port (default is 3306) and configure networking as required.
Choose "Use Strong Password Encryption".
Set the MySQL Root Password and create any additional user accounts as needed.
Apply the configuration and complete the installation.
Finish Installation:

Once the installation is complete, you can start MySQL Workbench and connect to the MySQL server using the credentials you set up.


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
Check System Requirements
Before installing Docker on Windows, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

Configure Docker Desktop:

During installation, Docker Desktop may prompt you to enable Hyper-V and Containers features if they are not already enabled.
Allow Docker to make changes to your system when prompted.
Start Docker Desktop:

After installation completes, Docker Desktop launches automatically.
It will appear in your system tray (near the clock).

. Verify Docker Installation
Open Docker Desktop:

Look for the Docker icon in the system tray and click on it to open Docker Desktop.
Check Docker Version:

Open a command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.
Run the following command to verify Docker is installed and running
docker version

Run a Test Container:
