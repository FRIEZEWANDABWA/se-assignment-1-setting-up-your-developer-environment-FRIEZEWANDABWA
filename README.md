Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


FIRST PROCESS BEFORE THE INSTALATION,CHECK FOR COMPATIBILITY. the minimus specs should be:
4-bit processor with at least 2 cores and 1 GHz processing speed
4GB RAM
64GB storage space (in addition to the space for the operating system installation software)
DirectX 12 or later graphics card with WDDM 2.0 driver
A high-def display of 720p
TPM 2.0
Secure Boot-capable UEFI firmware

SECOND PROCEEDURE IS TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE 
Visit the site https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 to download the media creation tool.
Navigate to the Create Windows 11 installation media link, and click Download Now.

The download for the Media Creation Tool will begin.
Once the tool downloads, double-click on the file in your download and run it. You may be asked for permission to run the program, so go ahead and approve it.
Now that you have the Media Creation Tool running, follow the directions to download the ISO file (the file used to install Windows 11) to your device. 
Make sure you select USB Flash Drive when prompted to download the file directly to your USB drive and format it properly for installation later.

THIRD IS RUNNING THE WINDOWS 11 FROM A USB FILE
Plug the USB drive into the computer and restart the computer.
Before the computer fully turns back on, hold the F8 key. The exact command will depend on your computer.

When prompted, choose the boot order and select the USB drive option as first. Youâ€™ll then be told to press any key to continue booting from your specified location.
Your computer should start up as normal, but with Windows 11 prepared to install and run at the startup screen.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
